Hello Fellow Local Artisans!

The Laravel community liaisons (not their official titles) -- yes, Laravel now has such liaises -- are working with Chris Morrel, to create a Laravel Discord server for Laravel group organizers. This is a very recent thing -- happening just this month. 

Here is a quote from Chris at the top of the Server: `the folks at Laravel are hoping to use this channel to connect with organizers directly and help them thru sponsorship and other meetup support.`. 

So, just to let you know, there are new Community Liaises at Laravel + I have been corresponding with them actively + they are forming a new Discord server + I have been invited to this Server.
