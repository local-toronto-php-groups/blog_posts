Hello Fellow Toronto Area Artisans!

At the upcoming LaraconUS in July, in Denver, Laravel is hosting events for organizers. 

Is anyone in our area interested in going to LaraconUS as our local representative? You will attend the organizer events, and then I am thinking we'll have a special August meet-up to talk about it. 

As well, I say this half in jest, that you sit beside Vehikl at these events to conspire, and perhaps plan, together. Vehikl is Canada's only Laravel Partner (the last I checked), located in Waterloo near the Conestoga Mall. They run "GPUG" -- Guelph PHP User Group. This name is a bit of a misnomer, as they host for the Cambridge/Kitchenr/Waterloo area. Vehikl is an Laravel Toronto co-founder from way back, although not now. In short, they know us, we know them, even if you have not personally met anyone from Vehikl. 

I am pretty sure that Laravel will offer a 10% discount (maybe more, not sure) on your LaraconUS ticket. 

You must be able to cross the border. Passport, or whatever, in hand now. I heard that there are issues crossing the border,  but I do not know specifically what these issues are. Sorry. You will have, in hand, return plane tickets, conference booking, hotel bookings in conjunction with the conference booking, a conference website to refer... at least these used to be sufficient. I can refer you to a recent local PHP-er who talked at the Chicago PHPTek this month about his experience crossing the border.

If your employer does not sponsor your going to LaraconUS, then there is a very tiny small chance Laravel might grant substantial ticket credits. 

I have already told the Laravel Community Liaises that we want to send someone to represent Laravel Toronto, as I am not attending.
