## Update to the meet-up listing form to work on PHP.net

Well, there really was an issue, it was not my imagination. 

After successfully tracking down someone who could point me in the right direction, I was asked to submit an issue to a repo. Which I did, at [https://github.com/php/web-php/issues/999](https://github.com/php/web-php/issues/999). 

I will try this form to list our next meet-up.

## Meetup.com upgrading their discussion feature
Last month I received an email from meetup.com, saying:
> We’re making group discussions and event comments more powerful. At the same time, we’ll be introducing compatible capabilities to the remaining communication features. We look forward to sharing more details with you soon!

Hopefully, these enhancements will be a good way for us to communicate online between meet-ups.

## Video of Larry Garfield's talk at our June meet-up is up
I finally put together the video of Larry Garfield's talk, and the Q&A, about Property Hooks at are meet-up last month. 

The video is at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ02hWKHALM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ02hWKHALM).

I listed this link in the comments of the two PHP Annotated YouTube videos, that I mention in my video. 

Thank you to 7shifts for recording this meet-up.

## What I am thinking about for the Sep '24 - Jun '25 meet-up season
I am thinking about doing something different: a multi-part series about PHP Internals. 

I am thinking of inviting people to talk to us, via live remote if necessary, about various aspects of PHP Internals. And, then recording these talks, and releasing them as a series of videos for the benefit of our PHP Community. 

There are no meet-ups scheduled this summer.

Is there a Laravel topic that you are passionate about, that you would present in the fall? Let me know!

## York Region PHP: where would be a good spot for a meet-up?
It has been a very long while since we had a YR PHP meet-up. Where would be good to have a meet-up?
