# Spring into Action!


<br />

This is Bob Bloom. Lead Organizer of GTA PHP, York Region PHP, and Laravel Toronto.

I am trying something new: a new repo just for blog posts. 

We had a very good meet-up in late January at Microsoft. We had a typical lull in February. 

Now, it is time to "spring into action"!

## I cannot get the meet-up listing form to work on PHP.net
The PHP website has conferences and meet-up listings, at [https://www.php.net/cal.php](https://www.php.net/cal.php). 

I have not been able to get the form to work to list our meet-ups. As well, I have not been able to edit our Groups' profiles.

If you have been wondering why our meet-ups have not been listed on the official PHP website, it is because the forms and I are not getting along. 

I have been trying over the last many months to contact someomne to help me out with the forms. I have not been able to connect with anyone who knows who can help me, or who can directly help me out. 

If you know whom I am supposed to contact, let me know!

## Suggested meet-up group listing at Laravel.com
The Laravel website has a "meetup" subdomain, at [https://meetup.laravel.com](https://meetup.laravel.com).

However, this subdomain is not for listing local meet-ups. It is for a specific meet-up event.

I emailed Laravel to suggest they add local meet-ups to their website, which was received favourably.

## How should we proceed to connect between meet-ups?
Over the years, and by "years", I actually mean close to a decade, we have attempted to do something online where we can connect between meet-ups.

I want to give this another try. 

I am not sure how to go about it, and I could really use some darned good advice.

Our last try at this was doing a Discord server. Basically, if I may put it this way, no one gave a shit. 

It would be great just to chit-chat with you, and with each other. It would be very good for me to send a link to "@everyone" to my blog posts. 

What do you think about this?

## Upcoming Laravel Toronto meet-up
We should have a meet-up about the new Laravel Framework v11. Lots of changes. 

I just received an email about someone doing the presentation -- FANTASTIC! 

- who wants to host it?

- which date is good? Thursday March 28? Thurs April 04? Thurs Apr 11th? Oh no.. wait, Friday March 29th is Good Friday.

## Coffee and Code in York Region

Ah, there was a time... when "Coffee and Code" was a thing, especially up here north of Steeles. 

Personally, I have been pining a bit for a casual get-together, along the lines of "Coffee and Code". 

Especially in south Richmond Hill area, naturally, because that is where I am. But, in general, it sure would be nice to do this in York Region, we've not had anything happen up here in a while. 

- where would you suggest we have "Coffee and Code" in York Region? Elsewhere?
- when would be a good date/time for you?

## We might have an opportunity to do another meet-up at Microsoft

Our [Jan 25th meet-up at Microsoft](https://github.com/local-toronto-php-groups/2024january25_meetup_gta-php) went very well. We might have an opportunity to hold another meet-up at Microsoft Canada, by way of Microsoft's Reactor, this fall.

If we do, at minimum, I am going to need help on "Game Day":
- someone (who is not me) has to be downstairs at the lobby, helping attendees with the elevators
- someone (who is not me) has to be at the front doors, on the 43rd floor
- someone (who is not me) has to moderate the online chat, if we have it open
- someone has to MC the presentations (I think I should start things off with a one minute intro, and then call up the MC)

We should also take the opportunity to "conference-ize" the meet-up, to take full advantage of the incredible space and location:
- rustle up some sponsorship to upgrade the food, which we will have to pay for
- invite "celebrity" speaker(s), which may end up needing sponsorship

Caveat: Microsoft may want our presentations to be about specific topics. 

In terms of time, I need to indicate to Microsoft Reactor this month our wanting to do a meet-up in the fall -- my preference is October or November. 

What do you think?
