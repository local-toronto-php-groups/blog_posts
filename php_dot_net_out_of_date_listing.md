Hello from Toronto, my fellow PHP-ers,

This is Bob Bloom, Lead Organizer of GTA PHP -- "Greater Toronto Area PHP", or in its more unoffical name, Toronto PHP. 

GTA PHP is a very well established PHP Group. Today, we stand on the shoulders of those dedicated PHP developers, and corporate hosts, who started and ran it for over a decade. 

They very wisely sought to list on PHP.net. At the time, they entered their ongoing, recurring meet-ups, held on the first of the month. We are long past those arrangements. 

Editing the listing... well, there is no login. To edit it, I would have to chase this issue down. 

I have already chased an issue with the site down, which, in all honesty, took a bit of doing. The reason why there were no other of our meet-ups listed, is because I had an issue with the submit form. Well... it turned out that my issue was legit. See:

- [https://github.com/php/web-php/issues/999](https://github.com/php/web-php/issues/999)
- [https://github.com/php/web-php/pull/1017](https://github.com/php/web-php/pull/10170)

Thank you for fixing this issue! Although, at the time of this writing, I have not had an opportunity to enter new meet-ups, since the fix. Now, I have our October 10th meet-up to list. I just saw our recurring listing, along with the subdomain to nowhere. 

Well, the recurring listing and subdomain are going to remain on PHP.net, so I thought I would attach a redirect to the subdomain to point this blog post. We are an active PHP Group, with an absolutely fantastic corporate host. 

Check out this GitHub organization that I set up to see what's going on, and for our links to meetup.com.

Regards from Toronto. Looking forward to meeting you!
